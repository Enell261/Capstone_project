# Using clustering techniques to find student-friendly neighbourhoods in Tshwane

This project uses the Foursquare API to find neighbourhoods that would most suit student living in the Tshwane municipality. It can be used to suggest safer neighbourhoods for incoming students and students looking to move. It can also be used by the general public to find new places to live, depending on what suits their needs best.
